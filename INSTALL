Readme

This is a forum; features:

  - topics divided into pages, can change order
  - support for forums and subforums through taxonomy; container terms are used to group forums
  - show how many new topics there are for a user
  - funky icons for topics and to show if a topic is new/updated (optional)
  - to move a topic just change its terms; you can decide if you leave a "shadow" (a link to the new forum)
  - you can "close" a topic: just set to read-only its comments
  - separation between html and code
  - block with active (last updated) topics
  - quite fast; if you need even more speed enable internal caching
  - funny things like last post author and date, number of replies, icons

Requirements
------------

This module requires Drupal version 4.0.


Installation
------------

1. Create the SQL tables.
     mysql -u username -ppassword drupal < forum.sql
   This doesn't delete any current forum.

2. Copy the forum2.module to the Drupal modules/ directory. Enable in site configuration.

3. Assign a taxonomy vocabulary to forum2. This will be used to browse forums, so it should be required; it can support hierarchy, even with multiple inheritance (subforums will just appear twice); the vocabulary should not allow multiple terms. You can assign other vocabularies if you like.

4. In site configuration assign the vocabulary to forum2, and check other options.
   

Themes
------

You can customize forum appearance in your themes defining these methods: forum2_render, forum2_forum_list, forum2_topic_list, forum2_topic_browser. Take a look at current implementation to get an idea.

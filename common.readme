this patch enables saving of arrays in variables.
it adds some overhead, both in computation time and in space in the db, but not too much imo

add to update:
$result = db_query("SELECT name, value FROM variable");
while ($var = db_fetch_object($result)) {
  db_query("UPDATE variable SET value = '%s' WHERE name = '%s'", serialize($var->value), $var->name);
}

/*
  - to make a forum you HAVE to assign at least one vocabulary (you could create a vocabulary specific to forums, or use an already defined vocabulary)
  - related terms not supported, terms must NOT be required, multiple supported, hierarchy not supported but in todo
  
  features:
  - topics divided into pages, can change order
  - show how many new topics/replies are there for a user
  - funky icons for topics and to show if a topic is new/updated (optional)
  - mixes well with taxonomy-based permissions
  - to move a topic just change its terms
  - multiple terms are supported, and topics will appear in every selected forum. right now this can be confusing, it is not specificated that it appears in different forums
  - you can "close" a topic: just set to read-only its comments

  comment.patch:
  + fix bug which lets a user poke at forbidden comments using reply
  - when a user adds a comment, default subject should be "re: $node->title" (comment.patch)
  + comments of a node can be "read only", "read/write" (enabled), disabled

  todo:
  + just one vocabulary for browsing
  - cache index and topic structures
  - separate html and code (theme_invoke)
  + if no vocabulary, just one level of forum (no)
  + admin can choose categories which are not containers of topics, but just of other forums
  - check why forums appear in queue too; some users post immediatly, others do not?
  - save user settings

  minor:
  - forum icons
  - topic icons
  - topics per page
  - number of topics in forums

  cache:
  - clean triggers: add comment (later, with hook), add node, timer



  - show meaning of folder icons
  - review table indexing and profile
  - moved topics (shadow could be a forum property)
  - in the first page, number of new topics for that user
  - user preferences: how many topics, in which order; checkbox in topic settings to "save settings"
  - block with active (last) topics
  - search
  - review use of the taxonomy api (export some functions to taxo)
  - hierarchy, useful?
  - what if a topic belongs to more than one term? could be interesting: "this topic talks about both arguments, so it appears in both categories" (advanded)
  - split a topic (boooring)
  - visible/invisible topics (this has more to do with taxo)
  - wizards for easy permissions?
  - start new topic in forum summary

  about permissions:
  you can set permissions so to have different configurations. remember you can set permissions globally or based on a term. interesting permissions to set are: "access content" (read topics), "post content" (write a new topic), "post comments" (reply to topics)
  
  a user that has "administer nodes" can:
  - open/close topics (set comment to "read/write" or "read only")
  - edit a topic
  - delete a topic
  - in the future "move a topic", with the option to leave a "shadow" (a message to show where the topic has been moved)
  
  pay a lot of attention not to give too many permissions! if you give a user a certain permission for a certain term, he will have that permission for every node with that term, not just forums!!
